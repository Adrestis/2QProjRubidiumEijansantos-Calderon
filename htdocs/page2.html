<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>Your first step when beginning your adventure in a game of Dungeons and Dragons is to imagine and create a character of your own, formed from your imagination. This character from your mind is a combination of various game statistics, different roleplay hooks, and your imagination. To create a character, you choose a race, such as human or elf, and a class, such as a fighter or a cleric. In addition to that, you invent a personality, backstory, and appearance for them. Upon completing this character creation, the character acts as your avatar and representative in the world you find yourself in.</p>
<p>Before beginning the process, make sure to stop and think about what kind of character you want to play for the game you're joining, whether it be combat-focused or roleplay-focused. Do you want to be in the frontlines, swinging and cutting down hordes of foes? Then the fighter or barbarian class might suit you. Want to sling bolts of flame and spears of energy from far away to fell dangerous beasts? Then a wizard or sorcerer might suit you. It all depends on what role you want to play, what niche you want to fill. In case you're not quite sure about what you want to play, browse some of the art or online content and see what appeals to you. </p>
<p>Regardless of what you may start with, know that over time, your character may evolve as the game goes on, both in power and in personality as they develop. Even if they change from your original concept, as long as you're excited to play them, then that's what matters. </p>
<p>Take note that your character is recorded via your 'character sheet', an item that may vary between a proper character sheet, written down notes, or a digital record. A character sheet is used to record things like ability scores, class features, race features, etc., and it is suggested to use a formal character sheet when starting out, but you can branch out once you understand the game better. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="choosearace"> Choose a Race </h2>
<p>Every character in D&D belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent and normally humanoid species in the D&D world, though with homebrew there can be exceptions to the humanoid part. The more commonly used races for player characters include humans, elves, dwarves and halflings, but there are many more to be chosen from. Some races also have subraces with their own features, such as mountain dwarves or wood elves, but that subject matter is better discussed in a separate page.</p>
<p>The race that you choose is a big contributor to your character's identity, establishing a basic template for your appearance, your talents from your race's culture and ancestry, etc. Your character's race can grant different racial traits depending on the race's origin and history, such as special senses, certain proficiencies, some minor spells of limited use, and other such features. Some of these traits and races can combine very well with certain classes, such as high elves and wizards, but playing against type is also a possibility, and can lead to memorable moments and such.</p>
<p>Do note that the race that is chosen grants you an increase to one or more of your ability scores, which are to be determined in a later section of this page. Make sure to remember these increases and apply them later on. Also remember to record your racial traits, starting languages, and base speed in your character sheet for later reference. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="chooseaclass"> Choose a Class </h2>
<p>In addition to being part of a race, every character in D&D also belongs to a class. A class broadly describes the training and vocation of a character, various special talents they may possess, the tactics they may use when approaching various risky situations, and other information. As with further information on races, this subject matter is better described in another separate page, though this section will still be the most complex of all of them.</p>
<p>Depending on your chosen class, your character will gain a number of benefits from said class. These benefits are class features and proficiencies - class features are capabilities that set you apart from other classes, such as spellcasting, extra attacks, etc., while proficiencies, whether with armor, weapons, skills, tools, or languages, define what your character can do particularly well, whether it be using a weapon or persuading an enemy to surrender.</p>
<p>Now, onto the more complex parts of your class: specifically, your level, your hit points & hit dice, and your proficiency bonus. First is your level.</p>
<p>Characters typically start at level 1 and advance in levels whether through the experience point system or through milestone levelling determined by the DM. 1st level characters are commonly new or inexperienced to the world of adventuring, though they may have been in dangerous careers before, and starting at this level marks your character's beginning of their career. Your DM may also have you start at a higher level with the assumption that you've already survived some adventures. Now, onto hit points & hit dice.</p>
<p>Hit points are used to determine how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations, and they are determined by your hit dice, short for hit point dice, as well as your Constitution modifier. At level 1, you have 1 hit dice, with the die type being determined by your class, and as you level up, you gain a hit dice for each level. You start out with a number of hit points equal to the maximum roll of your hit dice, plus your Constitution modifier. This also acts as your hitpoint maximum, which grows as you level up. You can also spend hit dice to regain hit points while resting. Now, onto your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>In your class description, the table which shows your class features and such also shows your proficiency bonus, which starts at +2 for a 1st level character. This bonus applies to many numbers that you'll be recording on your character sheet, like attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws. Your proficiencies wherein you add this bonus come from your race, class, and other sources. Your proficiency bonus cannot be added to a roll or a number more than once normally, but it might be modified like with expertise or certain class features.</p>
<p>As with the last section, do note that there are further complexities to classes, such as multiclassing, which cannot be covered here. In addition to that, remember to record all of the aforementioned characteristics: 1st level features, your level, your hit points and hit dice, and your proficiency bonus. </p>

<h2 id="determineabilityscores"> Determining Ability Scores </h2>
<p>In addition to your race and class features, much of what your character can do depends on your six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These six scores come in the form of numbers which are written down on your character sheet, and they each have their own uses in a D&D game.</p>
<p>There are various ways to generate ability scores, whether via the '4d6, drop the lowest' method, the point buy method, by going with the normal array of 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8, or some other method of choice. After generating these numbers, you can assign them to individual ability scores, and then add bonuses from your choice of race.</p>
<p>After doing all of that, you determine your ability modifiers by subtracting 10 from the ability score, then dividing the result by 2 and rounding down if needed. Do note that each score is good for certain classes depending on their capabilities, like how Strength or Dexterity are good for fighters, or how Charisma is good for sorcerers or warlocks, or how Constitution is good for everyone. Also, make sure to record your ability scores in your character sheet. </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="describecharacter"> Describe your Character </h2>
<p>Once you've dealt with the statistics side of your character, it's time to develop the roleplay side of your character. Give them a name that follows their culture's naming trends or goes against it depending on their family. Have their appearance be average or extraordinary. Decide whether they'd follow their traditions or rebel against them, and why they chose one or the other. You can also use your ability scores to describe their appearance, with them possibly looking bulky or gaunt depending on their Strength, healthy or ill depending on their Constitution, and so on and so forth. This is where you flesh your character out as a person.</p>
<p>For starters, you choose your alignment, which is a rough approximation of your character's moral compass, and your ideals that you hold yourself to, whether good, bad, or neither. You can give your character some unique personality traits, elaborate on the bonds that your character hold dear, and explain the flaws which may lead to your failure. You also choose a background, which further describes where your character came from, their original occupation, and their place in the world, as well as giving a feature, some proficiencies and maybe languages. While there are backgrounds coming from various D&D books, you can work with your DM to make your own if needed. All of this is to be recorded on your character sheet.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="chooseequipment"> Choose your Equipment </h2>
<p>Your character, for all of their skill and prowess, still require tools to aid in their quests, and these tools come in the form of equipment. The equipment that you gain at the start is determined by your class and background, which you record in your character sheet. You can also gain a number of gold pieces depending on your class instead in order to buy your own starting equipment. However, the amount you can carry is limited by your Strength score times 15 in pounds, so make sure to keep an eye on that total weight.</p>
<p>Some of your equipment, specifically your armor and weapons, have their own values - armor class, attack rolls, and damage rolls. Armor class, or AC, depends on whether you have and are proficient in armor and a shield or not, but without either, your AC is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier, unless you have something like a class feature or a spell that alters your AC. As for attack and damage rolls, your attack roll modifier which you add to your dice rolls is equal to your Strength (melee weapon) or Dexterity (ranged weapon) modifier plus your proficiency bonus if you're proficient in the weapon. As for your damage roll modifier, it's just your Strength or Dexterity modifier. Make sure to take note of these as well.</p> 
</section>

<section>
<h2 id="bandingtogether"> Banding Together </h2>
<p>Lastly, always remember that no adventurer can easily stand and survive alone; adventuring parties exist for a reason. Each character plays a role in that party, whether it be damage, tank, or support. Teamwork and cooperation is key, so it's always good to coordinate with your party and your DM on who'll play what role, and how some characters may already be connected before the whole party is assembled. Always remember that D&D is as much of a team game as it's a solo game: work together, survive through thick and thin, build a legend for yourselves, and you'll have fun no matter what happens, because you're together and enjoying the experience.</p>

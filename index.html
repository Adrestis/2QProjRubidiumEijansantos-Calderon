<h2> Dungeons & Dragons, explained:</h2>
<p>So to begin, Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game which was originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, and first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. Since then, it has been published by the now more well-known game publisher, Wizards of the Coast, and has been since 1997.</p>
<p>The core of D&D is storytelling: you and your friends tell a story together, guiding your characters through grand adventures for treasure, life-threatening battles with deadly adversaries, daring rescues, silver-tongued courtly intrigue, and much more. There are many avenues by which to explore the world of Dungeons & Dragons, whether it be novels, board games, or even immersive video games. All of these are part of D&D.</p>
<p>That is the essence of Dungeons & Dragons. If you read further into this website, then it may provide a bit more of an explanation of the proper rules of Dungeons & Dragons. But it is always important to remember that Dungeons & Dragons isn't just a numbers game, it's also a roleplaying game, a storytelling game.</p>

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>Dungeons & Dragons is built around storytelling, whether through roleplay, combat, exploration, or a mix of any of the three. The game is driven by imagination, like picturing a crumbling castle in a dense forest and imagining how a fantasy adventurer would react to such a thing, to the challenges it presents. In the fantasy worlds of D&D, the possibilities are limitless. </p>
<p>However, unlike simple games of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, adds consequences to the actions of the adventurers. Those who play roll dice to determine how well their characters do, whether their attacks hit or miss, whether they can scale mountains or dodge blasts of arcane flame, or manage some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others. </p>
<p>This website is meant to inform readers about Dungeons & Dragons: help them learn should they be new to it, allow them to understand their role in the game, and generally teach them about Dungeons & Dragons. While this website is in no way a comprehensive guide, hopefully, it can at least be of some use.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let me begin my explanation of the roles around the table of this tabletop roleplaying game: specifically the players participating in the adventure, and the Dungeon Master guiding them. </p>

<h2 id="roleoftheplayers"> Role of the Players </h2>
<p>When you play D&D, you become an adventurer, taking on one role or another: a skilled fighter, a magical wizard, a devout cleric, a mighty paladin, a stealthy rogue, or another such role.</p>
<p>The first step a player takes is to imagine and create a character of your own: a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks to build a story, and your imagination to fuel it. You choose a race, such as human or elf, and a class, such as fighter or wizard, and then build around your choices, making a personality, an appearance, and a backstory. When finished, this character represents you in the game.</p>
<p>With friends beside you and that spark of imagination in your mind, you can journey onward to glorious quests and dangerous adventures, testing yourself against challenges, monsters, and whatever else the world of your game has to offer.</p>
<p>Resources and further information can be found in the Player's Handbook.</p>

<h2 id="roleofthedm"> Role of the Dungeon Master </h2>
<p>While the majority of the players take on the roles of characters, one player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (or DM), the game's main storyteller and referee. They are in charge of the adventure, while the characters navigate said adventure's hazards and decide where to explore.</p>
<p>The DM puts a scenario before the players and determines the possible situations depending on the course of action chosen by the players. For example, a DM may describe an entrance to a cave buried within a hill, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. Do they want to walk right in, or sneak past any possible guards, or simply decide to throw an explosion of flame into it?</p>
<p>The DM determines the results of the chosen course of action and narrates the experiences the characters undergo. Since a DM can decide situations and improvise to react to any crazy or genius plans the players concoct, D&D is infinitely flexible, and many exciting and surprising events can occur in an adventure.</p>
<p>For DMs, further resources and information can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p>

<h2 id="anongoingadventure"> An Ongoing Adventure </h2>
<p>One of the amazing things about Dungeons & Dragons is that it never truly ends. When one adventure or story is finished, another can begin, and the two can potentially feed into each other, making an ongoing story: in other words, a campaign. Many players keep campaigns going for months or years, meeting with friends each week to pick up the story from where they left off.</p>
<p>As the campaign continues, the adventurers grow stronger: with each enemy defeated, each quest completed, and each treasure recovered, they not only add to their continuing story, but they also add to their capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.</p>
<p>In D&D, there is no winning or losing, at least not in the traditional sense. Working together, the DM and the players build a creative and expansive story of brave and bold adventurers confronting dangers and perils. Even if they do not prevail, as long as everyone enjoyed the adventure and created a story to be remembered, then they all win.</p>

<h2 id="whatsnext"> What's Next? </h2>
<p>If you wish to continue learning about Dungeons & Dragons, there are basic rules and other websites online which can allow you to read up on the rules, as well the basics of character creation which are listed on this website.</p>
<p>In addition to that, any of the D&D starter sets can provide a complete D&D experience, enough for hours of play. And the best thing about said sets is that you can play through them multiple times and different outcomes are still very much possible, depending on how things turn out. However, the most rewarding thing about D&D is that it allows you to create characters, and even worlds, of your own.</p>
<p>If you want more variety in your characters or your monsters within your adventures, you can check out the fifth edition Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide. The content within these rulebooks introduces the vast multiverse of Dungeons & Dragons and gives you the means by which to create unique characters and worlds.</p>
